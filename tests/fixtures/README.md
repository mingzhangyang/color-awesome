# Test Image
This is a placeholder for test images used in E2E tests.

## Usage
- `test-image.jpg` - Standard test image for color picking tests
- `large-image.jpg` - Large image for performance testing
- `invalid-file.txt` - Invalid file for error handling tests

## Note
In a real project, you would include actual image files here.
For testing purposes, these files should be:
- test-image.jpg: A colorful image with distinct regions
- large-image.jpg: A large (>5MB) image file
- invalid-file.txt: A text file to test invalid upload handling
