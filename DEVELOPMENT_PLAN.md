## Technical Requirements

### Core Dependencies
- **Color Manipulation**: chroma.js or color.js
- **Image Processing**: Fabric.js or HTML5 Canvas API
- **File Handling**: File API
- **Local Storage**: localStorage API with JSON serialization

### Performance Targets
- [ ] Initial load time < 3 seconds
- [ ] Color conversion response < 100ms
- [ ] Image processing < 2 seconds for standard images
- [ ] Smooth 60fps animations

### Browser Support
- [ ] Chrome 90+
- [ ] Firefox 88+
- [ ] Safari 14+
- [ ] Edge 90+

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Large image processing performance**
   - Mitigation: Implement image compression and worker threads
2. **Browser storage limitations**
   - Mitigation: Implement data cleanup and compression
3. **Cross-browser compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing and polyfills

### Timeline Risks
1. **Feature creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict scope management and MVP focus
2. **Complex image processing**
   - Mitigation: Use proven libraries and algorithms

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All color formats convert accurately
- [ ] Images up to 10MB process smoothly
- [ ] 1000+ colors stored without performance issues
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design works on all devices
